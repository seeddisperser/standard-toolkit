# @accelint/map-toolkit

## Installation

```sh
npm install @accelint/map-toolkit
```

## Structure

- standard-toolkit/packages/map-toolkit
  - src
    - deckgl
      - [feature folders]
      - index.ts (generated by indexer)

    - [other technology folders, ex: maplibre]

    - ~~index.ts~~ (do not create a root level barrel, there should only be tech level barrels, but also support individual feature exports in package.json)

  - [misc files, ex: package.json, etc]

## Installing New Packages
Similar to DesignTK, all features within a technology MUST work together, to help guarantee this we will not publish them as individual packages, but as part of a single package.

In an effort to reduce the number of unnecessary dependencies being installed by consumers, we are opting to use `optionalDependencies`, instead of `peerDependencies`. This allows us for more flexibility, but also requires us to be more mindful of how these packages are being used.

### Example
`pnpm i --save-optional deckgl@latest`

## Usage
- Under Construction ðŸš§

## Storybook Preview
- To run storybook, use the command `pnpm preview` to run locally.
