This release introduces a Notice component to display notifications, alerts, and messages. The implementation includes an individual Notice component for single notifications and Notice.List for queue-based notifications. The system supports five color variants (info, advisory, normal, critical, and serious) with customizable action buttons, automatic timeout management, flexible dequeuing options, and portal-based rendering. View the [Notice component in Storybook](https://gohypergiant.github.io/standard-toolkit/?path=/docs/components-notice--playground) for interactive examples and documentation.
