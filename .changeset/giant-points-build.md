A refactor introducing breaking changes for the Tooltip component. The structure is now a light wrapper around the [Tooltip](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Tooltip.html) implementation. Tooltip has been replaced with Tooltip.Trigger and Tooltip.Body has been replaced with Tooltip. Reference the [docs](https://gohypergiant.github.io/standard-toolkit/?path=/docs/components-tooltip--playground) for implementation instructions.
